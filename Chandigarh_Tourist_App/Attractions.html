          distinction of being Asia's largest. The garden has not only roses,
          but also trees of medicinal value. Some of the medicinal plants that

          gulmohar. The rose plants have been planted in carved-out lawns and
          flower beds. Apart from serving as a host of other events, the Zakir
          Rose Garden serves as the venue for hosting an annual rose festival
          called Rose Festival, a major cultural event in Chandigarh during
          February or March. Celebrated mainly as a tribute to the magnificence
          of the rose itself, the attractions include food, drinks, joyrides,
          and contests of varying nature, such as photography, gardening,
          landscaping, bonsai, and Rose Prince and Princess. The contests are

          Sukhna Lake in Chandigarh, India, is a reservoir at the foothills
          (Shivalik hills) of the Himalayas. This 3 km² rainfed lake was created
          in 1958 by damming the Sukhna Choe, a seasonal stream coming down from
          the Shivalik Hills. Originally, the seasonal flow entered the lake
          directly causing heavy siltation. To check the inflow of silt, 25.42
          km² of land was acquired in the catchment area and put under
          vegetation. In 1974, the Choe was diverted and made to bypass the lake
          completely, the lake being fed by three siltation pots, minimising the
          entry of silt into the lake itself.
